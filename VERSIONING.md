# Automated Versioning Implementation Summary

## What Was Changed

### 1. **Source Code Changes**
- Modified `app/desktop/book.go`: Changed `const VERSION = "6.2.0"` to `var VERSION = "dev"`
- The version is now injected at build time using Go's `-ldflags`

### 2. **New Scripts Added**
- `scripts/version.sh` - Generates datetime-based versions
- `scripts/build.sh` - Builds with version injection
- `scripts/dev.sh` - Development utility script

### 3. **Build System Updates**
- Updated `makefile` with new build targets
- Updated `.goreleaser.yml` to use build-time version injection
- Updated GitHub Actions workflows for automated releases

### 4. **Documentation**
- Added `BUILD.md` with comprehensive build instructions
- Updated `README.md` with build documentation reference

## Benefits of This Approach

### ✅ **Best Practices Achieved**

1. **No Manual Version Updates**: Eliminates the need to manually update version strings in source code
2. **Automated Release Process**: CI/CD automatically generates and tags releases
3. **Traceable Versions**: Each build has a unique, datetime-based version with git commit hash
4. **Clean Git History**: No more version bump commits cluttering the repository
5. **Build-Time Injection**: Version is determined at build time, not at development time
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing workflows continue to work
7. **Development Friendly**: Easy local development with automated versioning

### ✅ **Version Format**
- **Format**: `YYYY.MM.DD-HHMMSS-{git_short_hash}`
- **Example**: `2025.07.16-094858-c24088e58`
- **Benefits**:
  - Human-readable timestamp
  - Unique for each build
  - Includes git commit for traceability
  - Chronologically sortable

### ✅ **CI/CD Integration**
- Automatic version generation on every push to main
- GoReleaser integration for multi-platform releases
- GitHub Releases with proper versioning
- Hugo static site remains unchanged

### ✅ **Developer Experience**
- Simple `./scripts/dev.sh build` for local builds
- `./scripts/dev.sh version` to check current version
- `./scripts/dev.sh run` for build-and-run workflow
- Compatible with existing makefile

## Migration Path

### Before:
```go
const VERSION = "6.2.0"  // Manual updates required
```

### After:
```go
var VERSION = "dev"  // Injected at build time
```

### Build Commands:
```bash
# Old way (manual version)
go build -o book .

# New way (automatic version)
go build -ldflags "-X main.VERSION=$(./scripts/version.sh)" -o book .
```

## Usage Examples

### Local Development:
```bash
./scripts/dev.sh build    # Build with auto-version
./scripts/dev.sh run      # Build and run
./scripts/dev.sh version  # Show current version
```

### CI/CD (Automatic):
- Push to main → Auto-generate version → Build → Release

### Manual Release:
```bash
git tag v2.0.0
git push origin v2.0.0  # Uses tag as version
```

## Key Features

1. **Flexible Versioning**: Supports both datetime-based and tag-based versioning
2. **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with no additional setup
3. **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
4. **IDE Friendly**: No source code changes needed for version updates
5. **Debugging Friendly**: Each build has a unique, traceable version

This implementation follows software engineering best practices by:
- Separating build-time concerns from development-time concerns
- Automating repetitive tasks
- Providing clear traceability
- Maintaining clean version control history
- Supporting both development and production workflows
